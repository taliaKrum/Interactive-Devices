## The Assignment: 
The goal is to create an interactive device with the following hardware: ESP32 TTGO T-display, a button, a joystick and a potentiometer. The devices will connect to your computer and send data back to your laptop for visualization, sonfication, or whatever media generation process you prefer.

From a hardware perspective, you will need to connect the specified components to the ESP32 and create an enclosure for the device. From a software perspective, you will write an ESP32 program that collects sensor data and sends it over either a serial or wifi connection to a laptop. You will also write a media generation program on your laptop to handle this data and create something interesting with it.
